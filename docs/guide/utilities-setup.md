## How to properly start the game
    
Due to the way Mod Organizer 2 works, running programs through it is a requirement in order to load mods. 
This is done in the top-right corner of the manager, where the program to run is chosen. 

Here, select ==F4SE==.

For the sake of convenience you may also create a shortcut (right below the Run button) so that you won't have to manually open MO2 each time before playing.

???+ question "What is the Root Folder?"
    If you do not know what the Root folder is, read the Key Terminology section from the Initial Setup page.

### Check if F4SE was correctly installed

    === "Inside the Root Folder"

        If you did everything correctly, your **Root Folder** should look like this:

        ![F4SE in Root folder](/assets/images/root.webp "F4SE in Root folder")

    === "Inside MO2"
        In order for the script extender to work, you need to **always** launch the game using the **f4se_loader.exe** file. 
        It will automatically be added to Mod Organizer 2 upon restarting it.

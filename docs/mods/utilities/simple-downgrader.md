## Downgrading the game

=== "Steam"

    We need to revert the game code to ==version 1.10.163== for wider modding support.

    ### Installation Instructions
    1. Download **[Main Files - Simple Fallout 4 Downgrader - for v1.10.984 0.3 :material-tray-arrow-down:](hhttps://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/81933?tab=files)** using the manual download button
    2. From the downloaded archive, extract **everything** to the game's ==Root== folder
    3. Double-click the ==fo4downgrader.exe== to launch it
    4. Wait for the `Patching successful` message in the console window that just opened
    5. Close the console

=== "GOG"
    The GOG version of Fallout 4 is already downgraded, you don't need to do anything.

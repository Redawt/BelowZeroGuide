In reality, about 90% of the Below Zero guide focuses on helping you build a proper, scalable, modern, and stable Fallout 4 setup \u2014 only about 10% is specifically about FROST itself. If parts of the guide seem unfamiliar, or if you notice mods you hadn\u2019t used before, it likely just means your previous setups didn\u2019t follow a fully optimized and modern approach.</p> <p>If everyone knew by default how to make proper Fallout 4 setups, this guide would be way shorter.</p> <p>Additionally, a lot of people have blamed FROST for vanilla bugs or bugs caused by broken mod setups. The number of false bug reports from players have been dropped dramatically since the creation of the Below Zero guide.</p> <p>A note about you and AI Chatbots</p> <p>I do not recommend using an AI Chatbot for modding related questions and help.</p> <p>I especially do not recommend to as AI Chatbots questions about this guide or to summarize this guide in some form, because they tend to fail pretty badly at those tasks. This is partially caused by AI chatbots associating \"Below Zero\" with the game \"Subnautica: Below Zero\", so they will \"forget\" or not understand that this guide is for Fallout 4.</p> <p>If you need help with the guide, join the FROST Discord  and ask your question there.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<ul> <li>The Midnight Ride Guide which heavily inspired this guide</li> <li>u/Kanonking for making the first proper FROST guide back in 2019</li> <li>Argon for also making a FROST guide in 2021</li> <li>krrptd for all his work on FROST</li> <li>BSJ Prophet for making Frost Plus</li> <li>Naugrim04 for creating FROST</li> <li>Greslin for managing the FROST PANPC patch</li> <li>All of our other active users over at the FROST Discord</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/requirements/","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>  This section tells you what you need for this guide. </p>"},{"location":"introduction/requirements/#accounts","title":"Accounts","text":"<ul> <li>A Nexusmods :simple-nexusmods: account</li> <li>Optional: A Discord  account<ul> <li>You need Discord if you want to download PANPC, the best AI mod for Fallout 4</li> <li>All mods from Discord will be optional in this guide</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/requirements/#software","title":"Software","text":"<ul> <li>An English copy of Fallout 4 from Steam or GOG <ul> <li>Only the English version of the game is supported for maximum compatibility; translations can conflict with mods and cause </li> <li>The Bethesda.net and Xbox Game Pass versions of the game are unsupported, as they do not work with F4SE which is essential for many mods.</li> </ul> </li> <li>All DLCs for Fallout 4 (except the High Resolution Texture Pack DLC)</li> <li>Windows 10 or higher (64-bit)</li> <li>An archiving tool (I recommend 7-Zip)</li> <li> <p>The latest VC++ Redistributables:</p> <ul> <li>VC++ AIO<ul> <li>Extract the archive and run the included <code>install_all.bat</code> as an administrator.</li> </ul> </li> <li>2015-2022 X64</li> <li>2015-2022 X86</li> <li>Restart your PC</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>A text editor (I recommend Notepad++, but the default Windows notepad will work)</p> </li> <li>The latest GPU drivers (either NVIDIA or AMD)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/requirements/#recommended-hardware-specs","title":"Recommended Hardware Specs","text":"<p>Here are the (minimal) recommended specs for being able to run the game at 60FPS in 1080p with the High preset:</p> <ul> <li>Storage: SSD with 55 GB of free drive space</li> <li>CPU: Matching or surpassing the single-thread performance of a Ryzen 5 1600.</li> <li>RAM: 16 GB of RAM</li> <li>GPU: Matching or surpassing the performance of a GTX 960 or R9 290. 4GB or more of VRAM.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/requirements/#information-about-the-next-gen-update-of-fallout-4","title":"Information about the Next-Gen Update of Fallout 4","text":"<p>Fallout 4 got a \"Next Gen\" update in April 2024.</p> <ul> <li>Many mods do not support this \"Next Gen\" version, because it broke a lot of mods and has several severe bugs/issue</li> <li>The stance of the modding community is to downgrade Fallout 4 for maximum mod compatibility</li> <li>This guide will tell you how to downgrade Fallout 4 (it is very easy to do that)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mods/bug-fixes/bullet-counted-reload-system/","title":"Bullet counted reload system","text":""},{"location":"mods/bug-fixes/bullet-counted-reload-system/#bullet-counted-reload-system","title":"Bullet Counted Reload System","text":"<p> <code>Optional</code></p> <p>Fixes the infamous reload bug with lever action weapons.</p>"},{"location":"mods/bug-fixes/bullet-counted-reload-system/#installation-instructions","title":"Installation Instructions","text":"<p> Note: You need to download and install two files from this mod </p> <ol> <li>Download and install Main File -
